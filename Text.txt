MEC technology enables localized, close and
distributed deployments of applications, services and
contents by using computing, storage, and communication
resources of the edge devices which
are closer to the user equipment, thereby
improving the performance of mobile networks and the
quality of user experience. Recently, the
emerging technology of fog computing further extends
the traditional model of cloud computing and edge
computing. As shown in Figure 5.1, fog
computing exploits the computing, storage,
communication and control functions of the devices
from cloud to network edge until terminal, which
enables services to be distributed anywhere
along the continuum between cloud and things.
By flexibly allocating and managing the various
resources in the cloud-to-thing continuum,
fog computing can efficiently and intelligently provide
services for multiple vertical industries and
applications domains, which further reduces the traffic
load on communication networks, reduces the
transmission delay and computing delay, and
improves the resource utilization efficiency
and energy efficiency of the system.
